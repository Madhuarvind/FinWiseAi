/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and transactions.
 *  It also provides basic read access to categories, with write access potentially controlled via an admin role.
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only to the owning user.
 *  - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores transaction categories, publicly readable, with writes potentially restricted to admins.
 *  - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transactions for a user, accessible only to the owning user.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - User listing is disallowed.
 *  - User profiles and transactions are strictly owned by the user ID in the path.
 *  - Categories are publicly readable, but write access requires further implementation using an admin role.
 *  - The ruleset prioritizes authorization and does not enforce strict data validation in this prototyping phase.
